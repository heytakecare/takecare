**Take Care** is a magazine put together by five friends living between Glasgow and London. The debut issue is a collection of creative responses to what is widely acknowledged as the UK housing crisis. This issue was put together over the course of a year in an attempt to understand the housing crisis and its causes. 

**Itâ€™s tough out there. Take care of each other.**
